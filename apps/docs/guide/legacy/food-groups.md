# Food groups

Intake24 food groups categorization system has been deprecated and removed in [v2025.4](https://github.com/intake24/intake24/releases/tag/v2025.4) release in favour of more flexible tagging system / nutrient-based food classification.

If you wish to link the food records with food groups for legacy reasons, you can use the following mapping of food codes wto food groups.
